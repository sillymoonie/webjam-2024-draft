So currently
For the landing page/main page
    - index.html
    - scripts.js
    - styles.css

For each of the game page
    - sample.html
(currently i do numbers, cuz ig it's the simplest, but we can do other themes later like programming language, musics, cake, harry potter, games, animes, tarot lol)
    - game.js
    - game.css

To run the code or see what we are having, just open the html on browser
